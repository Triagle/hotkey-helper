#+TITLE: Hotkey Helper

Hotkey Helper -- Easily document keybindings

* What is it
Hotkey Helper is a little scheme program that parses =.sxhkdrc= files,
taking the hotkeys and some specially formatting comments to create a
documented list associating keybindings with their actions.
* Installation
This program requires chicken scheme, and a library called fmt.

Installing chicken scheme should be relatively easily, and likely
available in the repos of =insert distribution here=.

To install fmt, run =chicken-install -s fmt=.
* .sxhkdrc Setup
In order to use the program's functionality, you need to tweak your
=.sxhkdrc= to include special comments designed as documentation for
keybindings.

The special syntax for these documentation comments is any line
beginning with "# ;; ". Set these comments up above every keybinding
you wish to document.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Example keybinding with documentation
# ;; Quit bspwm
super + alt + Escape
    bspc quit
# This would show up in the formatted output as:
# su-alt-Escape                 - Quit bspwm
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Usage
To use the program, use =csi= to run the =main.scm= file, like so

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
csi -ss main.scm
#+END_SRC

You can also pass a path argument, for the location of your =.sxhkdrc=
file

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
csi -ss main.scm /path/to/.sxhkdrc
#+END_SRC

Upon running this command, you should get a formatted list of hotkeys
printed to the terminal, something like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[~/repos/scm/hotkey-helper] ->>  csi -ss main.scm
su-Escape                     - Restart sxhkd
su-alt-Escape                 - Quit bspwm
su-Delete                     - Suspend
su-sh-w                       - Show window list
su-w                          - Close window
su-b                          - Balance windows
su-(s|f|t)                    - Make window (float,fullscreen,tiled)
su-(grave|Tab)                - Goto last (window,desktop)
su-apostrophe                 - Swap last two window
Print                         - Take a screenshot
su-p                          - Open password manager
su-m                          - Make window biggest
su-(_|sh-)(h|j|k|l)           - Move window (left,down,up,right)
su-(_|sh-)bracket(left|right) - Go (forward,backward) a desktop
su-ct-(h|l)                   - Move window between monitors
button1                       - Focus window
su-button(1-3)                - Focus Window
XF86AudioLowerVolume          - Lower Volume
XF86AudioRaiseVolume          - Raise Volume
XF86AudioPlay                 - Play mpd
XF86AudioNext                 - Next song
XF86AudioPrev                 - Previous song
XF86AudioStop                 - Open ncmpcpp
su-Return                     - Spawn terminal
su-space                      - Run a command
su-i                          - Capture notes using org-mode
su-question                   - Show keybindings
#+END_EXAMPLE

The output is tabulated (thanks to the fmt library), so all the
descriptions are neatly aligned and easy on the eyes.

This output can be piped to the likes of dmenu, or rofi.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# An example from my own config.
# The file has been renamed and moved, but otherwise not changed.
csi -ss ~/bin/hotkeys.scm | rofi -i -p "Hotkeys: "
#+END_SRC

Doing this with a program like rofi allows for powerful searching of
hotkeys on the system.
* Screenshots
